# 11-3D-Game

In this short game, you are able to launch yourself around the level. 
Your goal is to collect coins, and reach the GREEN goal in each level.

For a personal challenge, you can try to see how few launches it takes to get to the end goal in each level.

To launch your character in a straight line, press the SPACE button.

To QUIT the game, press the ESCAPE key and close the window.
