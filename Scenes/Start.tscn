Your goal is to collect coins, and reach the GREEN goal in each level.

For a personal challenge, you can try to see how few launches it takes to get to the end goal in each level.

To launch your character in a straight line, press the SPACE button.

To QUIT the game, press the ESCAPE key and close the window.


When you are ready to begin playing, please press R. You can
also hit R at any point to RESTART your game."
